	landscape land/city19
	description "Alyria was one of the earliest planets colonized by the first settlers on the Rim, while it orbits a very hot star its located in the very outer edge of the habitable zone, making it colder than average, however the planet and its moon became a major stop for trade routes to Tarazed. Today Alyria is one of the most urbanized planets in the south, being home for one-and-a-half hundred million residents from all regions of space and thanks to its vast resources, a major industrial and scientific hub in the Rim."
	description "The largest industry around is the Prometeus AT Group which manufacture everything from home appliances to massive ships for both the civilian market and the militias that protect this space."
	spaceport "The spaceport is located inside the main urban center near the goverment house, and is divided into two sectors. The inermost sector is the oldest, built when the planet was first discovered it was the end point to various caravans, however it isnt capable of handling most modern freighters of today and its now used for smaller transport starships, the oldest facilities were closed off are being currently converted into a museum. The outermost ring, built 200 years ago, is on of the largest spaceports in the region, handlind everything from food convoys to shipbuilding parts."
	spaceport "Slightly outside the spaceport there's a smaller port owned by Prometeus AT that handles all sorts of equipment."

planet Imyria
	attributes moon research south tourism
	landscape land/snowvillaged
	description "Imyria is the first moon of Alyria and the only one that is habitable for humans. In the early days of the Rim, Imyria was used as a stopgap for repairing ships in long hauls taking advantage of the lower gravity. As things quiet down the moon settlement found new life as a tourist destination and education home especially for the increasing middle class of the Dirt Belt and the surroundings. As such more then half of Imyria residents are off-world students. Today the moon is home to various ski resorts, mountain climbing and vacation homes courtesy of the industries who provide substantial benefits to workers as well as large universities which atract many tourist every year."
	spaceport "Although not outdated in any sense the spaceport has a distinctive vintage style from the early days of the Rim. The main terminal is littered with advertisments for many resorts and schools in the zone and many buses come and go from the terminal. The port is located some kilometers of the main settlement which resembles an alpine village that you would see on old Earth movies. Just outside the the village there is a large education campus where many students qualify for the many industry-oriented jobs in the system."

planet Tianjian
	attributes "near earth" urban
	landscape land/city12
	description "In the very early days of hyperspace travel, most settlers chose to put down roots within a few jumps of Earth, because until more fuel depots were built, colonies farther out would seldom be visited by cargo ships. As a result, a lot of effort was put into terraforming and developing worlds that would have been passed over by most colonists today."
	description "Tianjian is one such world, and it is now overpopulated, and poor enough that maintaining the terraforming equipment and climate requires almost a third of the planetary government's tax income."
	spaceport `The "new port" here was built several centuries ago, when the grand but impractical spaceport built by the original settlers had deteriorated to the point where it was no longer usable. This port is much simpler by comparison: just a ring of landing pads of various sizes around a large central building with ten levels of warehouse space accessible by freight elevator.`
	spaceport "There are always locals hanging around the port, some of them mere children, who are trying to find a cheap ride off-planet."

	description "New Albion is one of the few worlds in the Dirt Belt region of the galaxy that is relatively prosperous and has a large population. Although the gravity here is slightly low, it is otherwise a nearly ideal Earth-like world, rich enough in natural resources that all the raw materials for the local industry can come from on-planet."
	description "Among the native life forms, the most striking are the many species of large and colorful birds, most of which have learned to give the cities and the spaceport a wide berth."
	spaceport "The spaceport is a granite ziggurat, a step pyramid with landing pads and hangars on each level. On the top levels are the dining areas and meeting rooms for corporate visitors; the lower floors provide warehouse and storage space."
	spaceport "Compared to the relatively traditional architecture of the city nearby, the spaceport looks out of place, even absurd. But to the locals, it is meant as a clear display to visitors that even though they are in a region of space known for poor and sparsely populated worlds, this particular world is far more developed."

Although the people outside the cities live pastoral lives, the cities are still the major centers of the economy, with many conmuting to visit or sell their products"

While modest compared to other ports near earth, this spaceport is well equipped enough to handle large containers that send the Planets products off world. Outside the cargo area, there is a shoping mall and a large nature park for those who stay."
